      <description>Back to Text Files Imagine my surprise that after 20 years of web development I have come back to text files and static sites.
My 5 year absence from the Internet gave me fresh eyes with which to see the current trends in development. Many of which are positive, many remain unchanged, and a bunch are just silly.
Even though I have been a content creator for 20 years, this is my first &amp;ldquo;blog&amp;rdquo;.</description>

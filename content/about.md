### This site

This site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)! This is my first time using Hugo for anything, and so far I like it the best of the static site generators. As I use it more, I will update this and tell you why I picked it for this and some other upcoming projects.

This theme is called [Hugo Coder](https://github.com/naro143/hugo-coder-portfolio) . I like minimalist for my personal stuff.
